Led a team of over 400 volunteers to deliver a week of online welcoming activities as well as some in-person programming for over 1000 incoming first-year engineering students, with a budget over $130k.
Adapted/re-conceptualized Orientation activities which included new initiatives to encourage community engagement, make it easy for people to make genuine connections with one another, and offer a memorable, positive welcome into their first year of university.
Oversaw the assembly/shipping/delivery logistics of 800+ U of T Engineering kits with swag, hosted international in-person meetups complying with safety regulations under COVID-19, ran online outreach/social initiatives, organized online study communities, and supported the re-design of orientation leader training.
