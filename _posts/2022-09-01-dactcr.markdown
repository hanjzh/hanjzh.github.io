Many real-world tasks often require collaboration of multiple manipulators necessitating dual-arm (DA) robotic systems. Leveraging the benefits of CTCRs in a dual-arm configuration, i.e. DA-CTCR, has great potential for applications in such areas. A hierarchy-based control framework is proposed to efficiently control and coordinate motions in a semi-autonomous manner for DACTCRs. This framework is validated in various assistive/motion coordination control schemes in simulation and on a real-robot prototype.
