We present CIDGIKc (Convex Iteration for Distance-Geometric Inverse Kinematics for Continuum Robots), an algorithm that solves these nonconvex feasibility problems with a sequence of semidefinite programs whose objectives are designed to encourage low-rank minimizers. CIDGIKc is enabled by a novel distance-geometric parameterization of constant curvature segment geometry for CRs with extensible segments.
