Generated meaningful bird's eye view images from 360\textdegree omnidirectional images taken on a small robotic rover travelling along a path through simulated Mars/Moon terrain. Reconstructed a flat orthographic map of a region around the rover at a particular time point using omnidirectional images and 3-D point clouds of the terrain. Corrected for variable auto-exposure of the multiple cameras (due to sun position) to improve the readability of that image.
